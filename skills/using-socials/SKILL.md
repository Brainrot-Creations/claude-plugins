# Working with Socials (MCP tools)

Follow this flow unless the user explicitly asks for something else.

## 1. Verify connectivity

- Call **`socials_check_access`** first.
- If the extension is not connected, tell the user they need a **paid** Socials plan (free tier does not connect), to stay signed in, and to keep the browser open with the extension loaded; do not assume tools work until access check succeeds.

## 2. Open the right context in the browser

- Use **`socials_open_tab`** with a concrete URL first. That tab is **pinned** as the Socials **agent tab**: feed, reply, scroll, search, and engage run there even if the user is focused on another tab or another **Chrome window**—automation uses the pinned tab id, not “the focused window.” By default the tab opens in the **background**; use **`focus: true`** to switch to it, or **`socials_focus_agent_tab`** to bring that tab’s window forward. Additional **`socials_open_tab`** calls open in the **same window as the pinned tab** when possible so a new empty window does not hijack the agent workspace.
- **`socials_get_agent_tab`** — see which tab is pinned. **`socials_set_agent_tab`** — pin an existing tab (e.g. X already open) by `tab_id` from **`socials_get_active_tab`**.
- Use **`socials_navigate`**, **`socials_reload_tab`**, or **`socials_scroll`** on the agent tab (omit `tab_id` unless targeting a specific tab). **`socials_get_active_tab`** is the **focused** tab (what the user sees), not necessarily the agent tab.
- **If platform is X:** use **`socials_x_search`** first, then **`socials_get_feed`** / **`socials_quick_reply`** / (optionally) **`socials_engage_post`** on results.
- **If platform is LinkedIn:** use **`socials_open_tab`** with `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/` and then **`socials_get_feed`** / **`socials_quick_reply`** (optionally **`socials_scroll`**) to work with posts and replies.
- **If platform is Reddit:** use **`socials_open_tab`** with the subreddit URL and then **`socials_get_feed`** / **`socials_quick_reply`** (optionally **`socials_scroll`**) to work with posts.

## 3. Read content

- **`socials_get_feed`** — recent posts from a feed (requires **Socials Pro**; extension should be on the right feed page).
- **`socials_get_post_context`** — thread/reply context for a **post URL** (Pro).
- **`socials_get_page_content`** — content from the **current** page after you have opened the right tab.

## 4. Drafting and posting

- **`socials_list_personas`** — when the user cares about tone or persona-backed generation.
- **`socials_generate_reply`** — optional AI-assisted draft from Socials (Pro); you may also write copy yourself.
- **`socials_quick_reply`** — posts a reply **in the browser** from the feed. **Always confirm exact text with the user before calling** — this is a real post.

## 5. Errors and limits

- If a tool says **not Pro** or **not connected**, explain clearly and do not retry blindly.
- Respect each platform’s terms and the user’s intent; prefer summarizing and drafting over automating spam or harassment.
